      "The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama.\n",
      "by Jane Mayetmo,\n",
      "(.s..\n",
      "David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred million\n",
      "dollars to right-wing causes.\n",
      "On May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a tall, jovial-looking billionaire tOok the\n",
      "stage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated for his\n",
      "generosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company's upcoming season,\n",
      "and had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's co-chairs, Blaine Trump,\n",
      "in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy\n",
      "Onassis, had been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch had\n",
      "bought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.\n",
      "The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has become one of the city's most prominent\n",
      "philanthropists. In 2008, he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize. Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre building,\n",
      "which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is\n",
      "named for him. This spring, after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Koch\n",
      "pledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in\n",
      "the city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, after he donated more than forty million\n",
      "dollars, an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.\n",
      "One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office\n",
      "said that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it might\n",
      "have created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth\n",
      "attacks on the federal government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.\n",
      "With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries, a conglomerate,\n",
      "headquartered in Wichita. Kansas, whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has\n",
      "grown spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in\n",
      "Alaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels,\n",
      "Dixie. cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Staimnaster carpet, and Lycra, among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largest\n",
      "private company in the country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch—who, years\n",
      "ago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest Men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is\n",
      "exceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.\n",
      "The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services\n",
      "for the needy, and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with the\n",
      "brothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political Economy\n",
      "Research Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States.- And Greenpeace issued a report\n",
      "identifying the company as a \"kingpin of climate science denial.\" The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly\n",
      "outdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change, unclerwriting'a huge\n",
      "network of foundations, think tanks, and political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns against\n",
      "so many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program----that, in political circles,\n",
      "their ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.\n",
      "In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report \"distorts the environmental record of our companies.\" And. .\n",
      "David Koch, in a recent, admiring article about him in New York, protested that the \"radical press\" had turned his family into\n",
      "\"whipping boys,\" and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for\n",
      "Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said, \"The Kochs are on a whole different level. There's no one else who has\n",
      "spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political\n",
      "manipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've never seen anything like it. They are the\n",
      "Standard Oil of our times.\"\n",
      "few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation—an organization that\n",
      "David Koch started, in 2004—held a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend, a summit called Texas Defending\n",
      "the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures,\n",
      "lie did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by a,dance\n",
      "performance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit,\n",
      "warned that Administration officials \"have a socialist visiOn for this country.\"\n",
      "Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An\n",
      "advertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. \"Today, the voices of average Americans are\n",
      "being drowned out by lobbyists and special interests,\" it said. \"But you can do something about it.\" The pitch made no mention\n",
      "of its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David .\n",
      "Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, said, \"What they don't say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought to\n",
      "you by a bunch of oil billionaires.\"\n",
      "In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson; denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party, saying\n",
      "that Americans for Prosperity is \"an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities.\"\n",
      ".Later, she issued a statement: \"No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or\n",
      "David Koch specifically to support the tea parties.\" David Koch told New York, \"I've never been to a tea-party event. No one\n",
      "representing the tea party has ever even approached me.\"\n",
      "At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans for\n",
      "Prosperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: \"We love what the Tea\n",
      "Parties are doing, because that's how we're going to take back America!\" she declared, as the crowd cheered. In a subsequent\n",
      "interview, she described herself as an early member of the movement, joking, \"I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!\"\n",
      "She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help \"educate\" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give\n",
      "them \"next-step training\" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be channelled \"more effectively.\" And she noted\n",
      "that Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs.\n",
      "\"They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board. I've certainly met with them, and I'm very appreciative Of\n",
      "what they do.\"\n",
      "Venable honored several Tea Party \"citizen leaders\" at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its\n",
      "Blogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama as\n",
      "the \"cokehead in chief.\" In an online thread, West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of \"demonic\n",
      "possession (aka schizophrenia, etc.).\" The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the actress best\n",
      "known for her role on the television series \"Northern Exposure.\" She declared, \"They don't want our children to know about\n",
      "their rights. They don't want our children to know about a God!\"\n",
      "During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama\n",
      "was \"the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office,\" and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—\"the government\n",
      "taking over our economy and our lives.\" Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, was the epic fight of our generation!\" As the\n",
      "crowd rose to its feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: \"Victory, or death!\"\n",
      "Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement's inception. In the weeks before the\n",
      "first Tax Day protests, in April, 2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters \"Tea Party Talking\n",
      "Points.\" The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for\n",
      "\"Taxpayer Tea Party Registration\" and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. The\n",
      "North Carolina branch recently launched a \"Tea Party Finder\" Web site, advertised as \"a hub for all the Tea Parties in North\n",
      "Carolina.\"\n",
      "The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to\n",
      "\"educate,\" fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. Bruce\n",
      "Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based\n",
      "think tank that the Kochs fund, said, \"The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and no\n",
      "Indians. There haven't been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been\n",
      "trying to create a movement.\" With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, \"everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there\n",
      "are Indians out there—people who can provide real ideological power.\" The Kochs, he said, are \"trying to shape and control and\n",
      "channel the populist uprising into their own policies.\"-\n",
      "A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, \"The\n",
      "Koch brothers gave the money that founded it. It's like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and the\n",
      "frogs come out of the mud—and they're our candidates!\"\n",
      "The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead, a prominent New York public-relations\n",
      "executive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York, and Mortimer\n",
      "Zuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch,\n",
      "called him \"a patriot who cares deeply about his country.\" Zuckerman praised David's \"gentle decency\" and the \"range of his\n",
      "public interests.\"\n",
      "The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities, \"To call them under the radar is an\n",
      "understatement. They are underground!\" Another former Koch adviser said, \"They're smart. This right-wing, redneck stuff\n",
      "works for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves.\" Rob Stein, a Democratic political\n",
      "strategist who has studied the conservative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are \"at the epicenter of the anti-Obama\n",
      "movement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill •\n",
      "Clinton. They are out to destroy progressivism.\"\n",
      "ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch\n",
      "printer who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., where he earned a degree in chemical\n",
      "engineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline; but, according to family lore,\n",
      "America's major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home, Koch\n",
      "found work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties, his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regime\n",
      "set up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch was\n",
      "deeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his company,\n",
      "Rock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had been\n",
      "destroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, \"As the Soviets became a\n",
      "stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot.\"\n",
      "In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the john Birch Society, the arch-conservative group known, in\n",
      "part, for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered President\n",

      "slogan was \"The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You.\" In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch,\n",
      "who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.\n",
      "Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that\n",
      "libertarians were getting ready to stage \"a very big tea party,\" because people were \"sick to death\" of taxes. The Libertarian\n",
      "Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the\n",
      "Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wage\n",

      "That November, the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand of\n",

      "sponsored principally by the Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission, Kibbe said, \"was to take\n",
      "these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent\n",
      "revolutions--Saul _Minsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example of\n",
      "nonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas, not candidates.\" Within a few years, the\n",
      "group had mobilized fifty paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charles,\n",
      "according to one participant, were \"very controlling, very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.\"\n",
      "Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated\n",
      "their business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of \"a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil\n",
      "from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring.\" The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one\n",
      "million dollars' worth of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oil\n",
      "measurement is \"a very uncertain art.\"\n",
      "To defend its reputation, Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss, then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soon\n",
      "opened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded, without\n",
      "issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal\n",
      "lives of committee staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Batten,\n",
      "the counsel to the Senate committee, said, \"These people have amassed such unaccountable power!'\n",
      ".'\n",
      "By •1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind of\n",
      "corporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on\n",
      "Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running advertisements, staging media events, and targeting opponents.\n",
      "And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as \"designed to strike fear into the hearts of\n",
      "wavering Democrats.\" Dan Glickman, a former Democratic congressman from Wichita, who supported the B.I.U. tax, recalled,\n",
      "\"I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of\n",
      "'resources and effort—their employees, too.\" Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. \"I can't prove it, but I think I was probably\n",
      "their victim,\" he said.\n",
      "The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names, and this made\n",
      "it difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoff\n",
      "group, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other environmental problems \"myths.\" When the\n",
      "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had \"no citizen membership of its own.\"\n",
      "In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called \"an audacious plan to pour millions\n",
      "of dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source,\" in order to evade\n",
      "campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in\n",
      "twenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group,\n",
      "the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested that \"the trust was financed in whole or in\n",
      "part by Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas.\" The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads,\n",
      "most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially active,\n",
      "the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the\n",
      "money, refused to comment. In i998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll had\n",
      "been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as \"historic. Triad was the\n",
      "first time a major corporation used a cutout\"—a front operation—\"in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of\n",
      "a company run amok.\"\n",
      "uring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the Justice\n",
      "Department filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills,\n",
      "which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two\n",
      "hundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to\n",
      "spend five million dollars on environmental projects.\n",
      "In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion\n",
      "that resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the final\n",
      "months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for\n",
      "covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company\n",
      "was liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.\n",
      "The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including\n",
      "the falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time,\n",
      "headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department, described the suit as \"one of the most significant cases ever\n",
      "brought under the Clean Air Act.\" He added, \"Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,\n",
      "and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.\"\n",
      "During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidacies\n",
      "of George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyed\n",
      "remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered\n",
      "enormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks, but, according to a\n",
      "study by Media Matters, their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since\n",
      "2000.\n",
      "In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reelection. The\n",
      "group's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support for\n",
      "John Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal, for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan political\n",
      "purposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)\n",
      "That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink\n",
      "started a new group, Americans for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who had\n",
      "worked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-\n",
      "consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biography\n",
      "describes him as an expert in \"grasstops\" and \"grassroots\" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an even\n",
      "greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known for praising \"throat slitters\" in politics, called\n",
      "Phillips \"a grownup who can make things happen.\"\n",
      "Last year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.\n",
      "Currently, its Web site claims that the group has \"1.2 million activists.\" Whatever its size, the Kochs' political involvement has\n",
      "been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity \"was micromanaged by the Kochs.\"\n",
      "And the brothers' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the family's other\n",
      "organizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.\n",
      "In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of \"the greatest loss of\n",
      "liberty and prosperity since the 1930s.\" That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives at\n",
      "a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern,\n",
      "thanked David Koch, and vowed to \"unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!\" Sodn after Obama assumed office, Americans\n",
      "for Prosperity launched \"Porkulus\" rallies against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a\n",
      "report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, the author was\n",
      "forced to correct the report, but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing.the paper, had labelled Obama's program \"a slush fund,\" and\n",
      "Fox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans for\n",
      "Prosperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, often\n",
      "guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)\n",
      "Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which organized what Phillips has estimated to be\n",
      "more than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; at\n",
      "another, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the \"Kill the Bill\" protests\n",
      "outside the Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.\n",
      "Phillips was a featured speaker.\n",
      "Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, which is aimed at making\n",
      "industries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed, with exaggeration, that even back-yard\n",
      "barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama's \"green jobs\" czar, Van\n",
      "Jones, and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting, his group as a champion of ordinary workers who would\n",
      "be hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference\n",
      "on climate change, declaring, \"We're a grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy\n",
      "families . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.\"\n",
      "Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington, including representatives from\n",
      "Americans for Prosperity, told me that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda. The\n",
      "Republican leadership in Congress, he said, \"couldn't have clone it without August, when people went out on the streets. It\n",
      "discouraged deal-makers\"—Republicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, the\n",
      "appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. \"K Street is a three-billion-dollar\n",
      "weathervane,\" Norquist said. \"When Obama was strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, 'We can work with the Obama\n",
      "Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what\n",
      "changed it. Now that Obama is weak, people are getting tough.\"\n",
      "As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached, David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphant\n",
      "Americans for Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator was working with\n",
      "the Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama's political ineptitude, and Tea Party groups\n",
      "were accusing the President of initiating \"a government takeover.\" In a speech, Koch said, \"Days like today bring to reality the\n",
      "vision of our board of directors when we started this organization, five years ago.\" He went on, \"We envisioned a mass\n",
      "movement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of life\n",
      "standing up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfully,\n",
      "the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are\n",
      "beginning to see the same truths as we do.\" .\n",
      "While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more recently he has come close to doing so,\n",
      "praising it for demonstrating the \"powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in government\n",
      "power, the massive efforts to socialize this country.\" Charles Koch, in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees,\n",
      "compared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense of\n",
      "imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, and\n",
      "since the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers' message has\n",
      "evidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.\n",

      "midterm elections, in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates, it nonetheless\n",
      "plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, and\n",
      "running ads aimed at \"educating voters about where candidates stand.\"\n",
      "Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum, their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink, interviewed\n",
      "by FrumForum.com this spring, said, \"If you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion of\n",
      "government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country, it doesn't look very good at all.\" He went on, \"It\n",
      "looks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day.\" He suggested that the Kochs needed \"to get\n",
      "more into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing.\"\n",
      "n 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As he\n",
      "was recovering, a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started a\n",

      "Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research,\n",
      "focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-\n",
      "Presbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research, twenty million to Johns Hopkins\n",
      "University, and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his generosity, Sloan-\n",

      "E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in great quantities, as a \"known carcinogen\" in humans.\n",
      "Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several major scientific studies have concluded\n",
      "that formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on\n",
      "•whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposed\n",
      "to higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel within\n",
      "the National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictly\n",
      "controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades, however, and Koch\n",

      "it to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2\n",
      "billion pounds. Last December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental affairs, sent a formal\n",

      "Harold Vannus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which he\n",

      "was ten thousand years ago. Overhead, the text reads, \"HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD.\" The\n",
      "message, as amplified by the exhibit's Web site, is that \"key human adaptations evolved in response to\n",

      "that levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are projected to increase\n",
      "dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible role\n",

      "the period in which humans evolved, Earth's temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\n",
      "fluctuated together.\" An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climate\n",

      "and he will have to be pushed, and you should engage him. But we probably know\n",
      "his zone of possible agreement. Not so with Bibi and, I believe, you are ideally suited\n",
      "to begin a series of in-depth conversations aimed at understanding his key concerns,\n",

      "Valley being one of them) and proposing more rational alternatives. But the point is\n",
      "that without getting Bibi to trust and level with us, without him feeling both what he\n",
      "has to lose but also what he has to gain, this process is unlikely to go anywhere.\n",

      "conflict; normal relations with the Arab world; and strengthened international\n",
      "legitimacy.\n",
      "III. Potential Downsides and Responses\n",
      "1. Dragging you into the weeds of negotiations. A risk exists that, though repeated\n",
      "meetings with Bibi and Abbas, you will be drawn into detailed discussions over the\n",
      "nature of the territorial compromise, the precise security arrangements, etc. This\n",
      "would be unhelpful both to the process and to you. There is a fine line between\n",
      "discussing the principles that should guide the final outcome and the precise details of\n",
      "that outcome, but it will be important not to cross it. Your role should be to extract\n",
      "from Bibi important understandings and parameters (e.g., security arrangements on\n",
      "the Jordan valley that minimize infringements on Palestinian sovereignty and\n",
      "minimize the duration of any residual Israeli presence) and then have your respective\n",
      "negotiators work out the details\n",
      "2. Disempowering George. A related danger is to render George powerless by creating\n",
      "the sense that everything can and should be dealt with through you. Besides\n",
      "potentially leading him to step down, this outcome would not serve your interests for\n",
      "the reasons just cited, your effectiveness being a function of your remaining\n",
      "somewhat removed from the day-to-day specifics of the talks. In fact, as I see it, this\n",
      "process could and should end up strengthening George's presently hand by clarifying\n",
      "it. Once you and Bibi will have reached agreement on broad principles, the two of\n",
      "you will provide instructions to your respective negotiators to find solutions that\n",
      "reflect them. In that sense, both George and his counterpart will have a stronger and\n",
      "clearer mandate than currently is the case.\n",
      "3. Involving you in a failed enterprise. Of all the potential downsides, this is the most\n",
      "significant one and ought not to be dismissed lightly. Failure is a real possibility.\n",
      "Palestinians are in disarray. The Arab world is profoundly divided, with forthcoming\n",
      "successions in Egypt and Saudi Arabia that will weaken two of the states upon which\n",
      "we most rely. And a serious questionmark hovers over Bibi's politics, his head and\n",
      "his heart. As a result, a powerful argument could be made that you would be better\n",
      "off keeping at arms' length from this process, especially given how much else is on\n",
      "your plate. That said, I disagree for the following reasons:\n",
      "a. By not getting involved, you risk the worst of two worlds: being associated\n",
      "with a failure (which, by virtue of your position, you inevitably would be) and\n",
      "being criticized for not having been engaged in an effort to avert it.\n",
      "b. Over the past year and a half, you have been involved -- traveling to the\n",
      "region; seeking to convince Abbas to enter into talks; commenting on the\n",
      "settlement freeze in Jerusalem -- and you will not be able to escape that kind\n",
      "of involvement in the future. The problem is that your engagement has\n",
      "appeared to be sporadic rather than strategic -- that you've been deployed\n",
      "when it has been deemed necessary to get out of an impasse rather than in\n",
      "order to implement a long term, well thought-out plan. I do not think that has\n",
      "served you well.\n",
      "c. While one cannot by any means be confident of success, I believe an\n",
      "agreement is possible but that it only has a chance if we can work effectively\n",
      "to bring Bibi into a position where he believes that the costs of a historical\n",
      "compromise are outweighed by its benefits.\n",
      "d. If we don't try all we can over the next year or year and a half, you will in all\n",
